# TrackConnect
This program will replace the IAAF table for collegiate use and pull data from the Track & Field over the past "decade". 

**Goal: Create a table that will allow a user to enter a time/length and see where the mark would place in the top 95 athletes of any event. The app will also display similar times in related events.**

This is meant for iOS usage with a possible Android app being developed as well.

All data is taken from https://tfrrs.org from the years 2010 to 2017
